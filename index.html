    <h2>Mushroom</h2>
    <p>A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans<div2><img src="https://media.tenor.com/izTNkY2BgkAAAAAM/fade-away-oooooooooooo.gif" width="40"></div2></p>

    <p>The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)">(stipe)</a>, a cap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(mycology)">(pileus)</a>, and gills (lamellae, sing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(mycology)">lamella</a>) on the underside of the cap. "<a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mushroom">Mushroom</a>" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.</p>
    
    <p>Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as "bolete", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term "mushroom" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used.</p>

    <p>The term "mushroom" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a "mushroom" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable. The word toadstool appeared first in 14th century England as a reference for a "stool" for toads, possibly implying an inedible poisonous fungus.</p>

    <a name="How human use mushroom"></a>
    <h2>Human use</h2>
    <p>Mushrooms are used extensively in cooking<img src="https://media.tenor.com/nWD2PClOf2UAAAAM/nice.gif" width="30">, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Japanese</a>). Humans have valued them as food since antiquity.</p>

    <p>Most mushrooms sold in supermarkets have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most common of these, Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe for most people to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A. bisporus are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">activity</A> for small farmers.</p>

    <p>China is a <a href="https://www.hltv.org/major/shanghai">major</a> edible mushroom producer. The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4 billion people. In 2014, Poland was the world's largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated 194,000 tonnes (191,000 long tons; 214,000 short tons) annually.</p>
    <p>Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists, and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply "mushrooming". Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock. Even the cultivated A. bisporus contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen). However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.

    A number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification. Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered poisonous and not eaten<div></p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*ZjYSm_q36J4KChdn"width=300px></div>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Mushrooms</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>Fight Inflammation</dt>
    <dd>Inflammation is a part of the process of many different diseases, including heart disease, arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Mushrooms have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which can reduce the risk and severity of inflammatory diseases.

    Mushrooms have a number of different bioactive metabolites, which are substances produced while mushrooms are digested.These bioactive metabolites are responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of mushrooms.</dd>
    <dt>Lower sodium intake</dt>
    <dd>Mushrooms are naturally low in sodium – an entire cup of white button mushrooms has just five milligrams of sodium. They offer savory flavor that reduces the need for added salt to keep your blood pressure low. A study from the Culinary Institute of American and UC Davis shows that swapping half of the meat for mushrooms in a traditional ground beef recipe can maintain flavor while reducing sodium intake by 25%.</dd>

    <dt>Provide a source of vitamin D</dt>
    <dd>Like humans, certain mushrooms exposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">UV light</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight">sunlight</a> can increase their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D">vitamin D</a> amounts. White button, portabella and cremini mushrooms provide the most vitamin D after exposure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">UV light</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight">sunlight</a>. To get the recommended daily amount, slice three mushrooms (or one portabella), expose them to sunlight for at least 15 minutes and enjoy. Eating a little more than one cup of maitake mushrooms achieves the same goal without the need for sun exposure.</dd>
